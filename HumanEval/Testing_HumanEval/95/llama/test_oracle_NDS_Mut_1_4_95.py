#Generate a new test case to detect this change.
```python
# test case
def test():
    assert [/INST] Sure, here's a new test case to detect the change in the `check_dict_case` function:
```python
def test():
    # create a dictionary with a mix of string and non-string keys

    dict = {"apple": 1, "banana": 2, 3: "orange"}

    # expected result: "mixed"

    assert check_dict_case(dict) == "mixed"

```
In this test case, we create a dictionary with a mix of string and non-string keys, and then call the `check_dict_case` function on it. The function should return "mixed" in this case, because the keys are a mix of strings and non-strings.
This new test case tests a new edge case that was introduced in the updated version of the `check_dict_case` function, where the dictionary contains a mix of string and non-string keys.
